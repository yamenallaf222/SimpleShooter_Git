If you want to Download the Project as an Unreal Project you can but there will be main assets missing cause i was not able 
to just include the references of the assets needed only resulting in a very big upload size thus i ought to have them excluded 
dues to issues with nested assets folders 


I ll include a link for an executable of the game if you wanna try it
